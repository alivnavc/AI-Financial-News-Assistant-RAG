Average Metrics: 
(Took average of 3 data points from Run 1 ,Run 2, Run 3)
(Note : This evaluation is based on only 3 test queries to assess the system's retrieval and generation performance. 
Despite the small sample size, the results demonstrate robust functionality, even in cases where retrieval yields just a single document.
The generated summaries are generally accurate and relevant, with strong recall indicating that the system retrieves pertinent information 
effectively.Also if we take more data points to test definately the Precision and F1 scores also improves a lot.)

Generated Summary:
 Jim Cramer has expressed a cautious yet optimistic view regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. He highlighted that while AMZN is a key player in both eCommerce and cloud computing, which includes AI exposure, he believes there are other AI stocks that may offer greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.

In his remarks from October 7, 2024, Cramer acknowledged that AMZN's shares had gained 26.5% since his previous comments, primarily due to a strong third-quarter earnings report. However, he noted that the stock dipped by 4% following its fourth-quarter earnings, which missed analyst estimates for cloud revenue growth. Cramer pointed out the challenges facing AMZN but refrained from outright recommending a sell, stating, "It's time to sell? I’m not so sure."

Moreover, he emphasized that factors such as energy spending and GPU orders would be crucial in determining the future performance of AI stocks, including AMZN. He ranked AMZN as the top AI stock among those he discussed but suggested that investors should also consider stocks with greater upside potential.
